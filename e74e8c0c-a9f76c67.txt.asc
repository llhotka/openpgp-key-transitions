Hash: SHA512,SHA1

In December 2016 I started migrating from my old PGP key (1024-bit
DSA) to a new 4096-bit RSA key because the old key is now considered
weak.

The new key is already available from public keyservers and also from
my MojeID public profile:

https://llhotka.mojeid.cz/

My MojeID account is fully validated, so this should be another strong
indication that the key really belongs to me.

The old key has not been compromised and will continue to be valid for
some time. However, the new key should be used from now on for sending
me encrypted mail and documents.

This transition statement is clearsigned by both the old and new key.

A downside of changing PGP key is that the my web of trust becomes
weaker. The new key is signed with the old one but since the old key
will remain valid only for a limited period, I would appreciate if
those who signed my old key consider signing the new key.

The old key from which I am transitioning away, is:

pub   1024D/0x5905428FE74E8C0C 2001-01-18
      Key fingerprint = 7E1A 3CB2 E44E E61E 61A3  2AF8 5905 428F E74E 8C0C

The new key to which I am transitioning is:

pub   4096R/0xB8F92B08A9F76C67 2016-12-17 [expires: 2018-12-17]
      Key fingerprint = B6BD 53C6 90AD 245F 0089  DE57 B8F9 2B08 A9F7 6C67

Please contact me by email if you have any questions regarding this document
or my PGP keys.
